This bot will monitor skins of your choice, and then purchase them automatically.
At the moment it works only with **CHROMIUM BASED BROWSERS!**
This bot will not work with stickers and cases, keep this in mind. *(You can check what is planned at the bottom of README)*. Also consider that I'm working on this project alone, so there's a chance that something won't work as it should. If you find a bug, open a ticket in the issue and I'll try to fix it.

## Features

- Skin monitoring
- Automatic purchase
- Logging into file after purchase
- You can choose specific patterns or floats for bot to find
- Buy only skins with/without stickers
- You can set max price for skin
- You can set max pages to look for
